Our goal is to improve treatment strategies and the clinical care of these patients. Analysis of large datasets (including EHR datasets and EEG datasets, among others) is central to these efforts.\\nSpecific efforts focus on developing methods for automatically abstracting data including clinical variables (eg medication doses, radiology, laboratory data) and clinical outcomes (eg medication adverse effects) on a large scale; creating tools to predict clinical outcomes in patients with seizures and abnormal EEG patterns treated with anti-seizure medications; and understanding the relationships between abnormal patterns of brain activity (EEG patterns) and neurological deterioration. Efforts will also focus on creating tools for data mining of structured and unstructured clinical data, including free text reports and clinical notes.',\n",
