Data Scientist Lead,156900,"As our Lead Data Scientist, you will act as an internal business consultant to help optimize every facet of this organization. You will solve problems and answer questions – using data – for other departments to help us reduce costs, reduce errors, and be a better organization for our 17 million members.  What You’ll Do  Every day, you will help solve business problems presented to us by stakeholders using data. You will get a scenario or problem, such as, “We need to reduce cycle times,” and then pull, analyze, and interpret data relevant to that scenario.  You will pull data from SQL databases. You will analyze and interpret data using Python, R, or other tools. You will determine patterns or trends and their statistical significance to the problem. To visualize the data, you will use Tableau.  Once you have done your analysis, paired with a data engineer, you will present your findings to the stakeholder and confirm, refute or simply acknowledge a hypothesis. Your work may be implemented or may develop into something else. This role is remote, but you must be able to report to the Costa Mesa. CA office for regular collaboration days.  What You’ll Need  To thrive in this role, you must have a solid foundation of statistics and data analysis. You must be able to describe a project where you pulled data, analyzed it, identified trends or patterns, determined significance, and delivered insights or recommendations to the business. What was your approach? What tools did you use and why? Did you get to the root cause of the issue? Did you confirm or refute a hypothesis? You must be able to speak to your involvement and decisions at each stage.  For pulling data, we use SQL so you must be proficient with this tool. To curate and analyze data, we use a variety of languages and programs: Python, R, and even Excel. You can choose whatever tool helps you best, but you must be proficient in either Python or R.  Excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility are a must. Very often, we get into the data and some aspect takes longer than we thought, or we have to pivot and change how we approach a problem. A dashboard works better than a model, perhaps. Then you have to explain to the stakeholder or the team why you made that change or why the deliverable is taking longer than expected. It’s all about being creative in your approach and communicating that frequently and clearly to people who may be less tech or data-savvy than you.  You have worked previously with an Agile team or understand these concepts. You expect to participate in daily standup meetings, you’ll complete your projects or stories during our bimonthly sprints, and you’re ready to meet frequent deployment deadlines.  #LI-SJ1  The starting pay range for this position is $134,500 - $179,300 annually.

The company has established a considerable intellectual property portfolio surrounding its CHIRP (Canary Health Internal Reporting Processor) technology to facilitate development of active implanted devices capable of monitoring patient function utilizing MEMs sensor technology in concert with sophisticated power management algorithms and wireless data transmission. The Canary ecosystem is comprised of an implantable smart device, a base station to transmit data from the device to a secure cloud structure, and a HIPAA-compliant cloud software system to store the information, convert the raw data to useful metrics, present said data on Patient and Clinician user interfaces, and mine data for clinical insights. The Summatix platform is adjunctive and seamlessly integrated with the Canary cloud enabling Clinicians to harness CMS RPM CPT codes in the delivery of patient care. Canary both develops its own FDA approved products and partners with major and minor manufacturers to incorporate its smart CHIRP devices into their partner’s FDA approved devices, allowing transmission of information without clinical interpretation or medical intervention. This minimizes the regulatory burden on the medical device partner, as clinically interpreted data fall under the usual FDA regulatory pathways. The company has a robust product pipeline in several therapeutic areas and is targeting a smart Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) implant as its first commercial US product within the next months, followed in quick succession by other total joint arthroplasty products (hip, shoulder) since approximately 90% of their core technology is shared across these areas. Canary’s cardiovascular efforts are targeting aneurysm, heart valves, and coronary stents monitoring. This aspect of the Canary product pipeline is earlier in development but is likewise expected to leverage core technologies from the orthopedic pipeline to reduce time to market, project costs, and regulatory risk. * Disclaimer:* Nothing in this job description restricts management’s right to assign or reassign duties and responsibilities to this job at any time.

Data Scientist [NYC],135389,"Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation? We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future. Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.  You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process. Working at CarbonChain To join CarbonChain, you'll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap. We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that's developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential. What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain? As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients. As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you'll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market. This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We're looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems. You can expect to have: Ownership of your projects Extensive client exposure The ability to make real changes with tangible business value Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers.
