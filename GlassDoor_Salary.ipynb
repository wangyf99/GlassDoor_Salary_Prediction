The purpose of this program is to counter PRC coercion, corruption, anti-competitive practices, and human rights violations related to supply chains in the extraction, processing, and transport of critical raw materials used in the construction, manufacturing, and energy sectors. SCIF will use its convening power to pilot a process designed to strategically target private sector investment opportunities in selected markets and locations as competition to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\\n\\nThe intent of SCIF is to facilitate strong public/private partnerships to build sustainable economic growth in partner countries; create sustainable and profitable private sector investments; and develop resilient supply chains that are resistant to market disruptions precipitated by the PRC. Leveraging the tools of the USG and select American Allies, SCIF will support development of opportunities that will be strategically selected to create critical natural resource supply chains and enhance emerging manufacturing processes in target countries. It is anticipated that these US and allied supply chains and manufacturing will promote sustainable, inclusive economic growth and align with national security objectives and US Agency for International Development priorities. The SCIF approach combines continuous business forecasting analyses with existing government market incentives which complement private venture capital strategies and proactively identify and facilitate investment opportunities, before PRC interventions can monopolize the emerging supply chain.\\n\\nThe Data Scientist, working with the research team, will build real time predictive models using machine learning and open source data mining to predict and forecast likely future outcomes for SCIF program opportunities, to include potential partners business and credit risks, corporate earnings, international markets, and or overall possibility for success.

We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.\\n\\nYou can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.\\nWorking at CarbonChain\\nTo join CarbonChain, you'll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.\\nWe encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that's developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.\\nWhat will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?\\nAs the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.\\nAs the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you'll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.\\nThis is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We're looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.\\nYou can expect to have:\\nOwnership of your projects\\nExtensive client exposure\\nThe ability to make real changes with tangible business value\\nOur data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.\\nOur only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.\\nWhich tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?\\nData processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond\\nMachine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch\\nData visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair\\nContainerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.\\nObject-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.\\nPostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.\\nInfrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).\\nTesting approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.\\nQuality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.\\nAgile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.\\nGitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.\\nContinuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.\\nTeamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.\\nYou don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.\\nWhat we require from applicants\\nRight to work in the US and willingness to come to the NYC office 2+ days a week\\n4+ years of relevant work experience\\nA passion for environmental issues\\nA demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers\\nThe grit and energy to work in an early stage startup\\nWhat we're offering\\nHealthcare\\nCompetitive salary + generous equity package\\nFlexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing\\n$2,000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things\\nTech equipment of your choice\\nRegular social activities\\nGenerous amount of holidays, 26 days of annual leave\\nWe're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.\\nIf you think your skills and experience match what we're looking for and you'd like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!\\nShow Less\\nReport\",\n",
