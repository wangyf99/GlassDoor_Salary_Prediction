You will solve problems and answer questions – using data – for other departments to help us reduce costs, reduce errors, and be a better organization for our 17 million members.

What You’ll Do

Every day, you will help solve business problems presented to us by stakeholders using data. You will get a scenario or problem, such as, “We need to reduce cycle times,” and then pull, analyze, and interpret data relevant to that scenario.

You will pull data from SQL databases. You will analyze and interpret data using Python, R, or other tools. You will determine patterns or trends and their statistical significance to the problem. To visualize the data, you will use Tableau.

Once you have done your analysis, paired with a data engineer, you will present your findings to the stakeholder and confirm, refute or simply acknowledge a hypothesis. Your work may be implemented or may develop into something else. This role is remote, but you must be able to report to the Costa Mesa. CA office for regular collaboration days.

What You’ll Need

To thrive in this role, you must have a solid foundation of statistics and data analysis. You must be able to describe a project where you pulled data, analyzed it, identified trends or patterns, determined significance, and delivered insights or recommendations to the business. What was your approach? What tools did you use and why? Did you get to the root cause of the issue? Did you confirm or refute a hypothesis? You must be able to speak to your involvement and decisions at each stage.

For pulling data, we use SQL so you must be proficient with this tool. To curate and analyze data, we use a variety of languages and programs: Python, R, and even Excel. You can choose whatever tool helps you best, but you must be proficient in either Python or R.

Excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility are a must. Very often, we get into the data and some aspect takes longer than we thought, or we have to pivot and change how we approach a problem. A dashboard works better than a model, perhaps. Then you have to explain to the stakeholder or the team why you made that change or why the deliverable is taking longer than expected. It’s all about being creative in your approach and communicating that frequently and clearly to people who may be less tech or data-savvy than you.

You have worked previously with an Agile team or understand these concepts. You expect to participate in daily standup meetings, you’ll complete your projects or stories during our bimonthly sprints, and you’re ready to meet frequent deployment deadlines.

This position is located in USAID’s Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation (DDI), and supports the Supply Chain Integrity and Freedom (SCIF) Program under DDI’s Center for Economics and Market Development, (EMD), in collaboration with the Asia Bureau and the Conflict Prevention and Stabilization Bureau. The purpose of this program is to counter PRC coercion, corruption, anti-competitive practices, and human rights violations related to supply chains in the extraction, processing, and transport of critical raw materials used in the construction, manufacturing, and energy sectors. SCIF will use its convening power to pilot a process designed to strategically target private sector investment opportunities in selected markets and locations as competition to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

The intent of SCIF is to facilitate strong public/private partnerships to build sustainable economic growth in partner countries; create sustainable and profitable private sector investments; and develop resilient supply chains that are resistant to market disruptions precipitated by the PRC. Leveraging the tools of the USG and select American Allies, SCIF will support development of opportunities that will be strategically selected to create critical natural resource supply chains and enhance emerging manufacturing processes in target countries. It is anticipated that these US and allied supply chains and manufacturing will promote sustainable, inclusive economic growth and align with national security objectives and US Agency for International Development priorities. The SCIF approach combines continuous business forecasting analyses with existing government market incentives which complement private venture capital strategies and proactively identify and facilitate investment opportunities, before PRC interventions can monopolize the emerging supply chain.

The Data Scientist, working with the research team, will build real time predictive models using machine learning and open source data mining to predict and forecast likely future outcomes for SCIF program opportunities, to include potential partners business and credit risks, corporate earnings, international markets, and or overall possibility for success.

We visit each community weekly to see patients and collaborate on patient health needs with staff. We also make it easier for patients to get care urgently with same- and/or next-day care, helping them avoid the ER and/or hospital where they're exposed to more health issues.
Our value-based offering has led to over 100 communities partnering with us in the last year and allowed us in achieving 10X patient growth. We're a fast-growing company that's backed by lead investors including First Round Capital, Google's AI fund, Canvas Ventures, Foundation Capital, Y Combinator, and Susa. If you share in our vision of helping every senior, no matter their health status, being able to lead a life they find meaningful and worthwhile, join us!

Additionally, you will develop a deep understanding of all the factors that influence seniors' health, participate in the product development process, all while supporting our clinical, care growth, implementation, finance and product teams.

Partner with the management team and project leads (clinical and non-clinical) to design and create input metrics and output metrics that guide improvement and decisions
Support project teams with quantitative work to inform hypothesis selection and evaluation.
Partner with Operations in instrumenting workflows, tools, and systems to collect high-quality data at scale
Develop reporting/dashboards and work closely with internal clients to iterate on content and form as business needs change
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure upstream data quality, develop robust data pipelines, and create tooling for clients to self-serve via Looker
Partner with our Product, Clinical, and Operations teams to design data-driven care delivery workflows and ultimately dashboard prototypes that will consistently deliver remarkably personalized patient care. To this end, you will occasionally spend time inside Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) shadowing our Growth, Ops & Care Delivery teams to gather the context required to make excellent technical design decisions
What We're Looking For
Bachelor's degree in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Data Analysis, or equivalent
2-5 years experience as a data analyst
Ability to develop detailed data request specifications based on existing company data model for de-identified patient data pulls as inputs into analytics projects
Intermediate SQL experience with data and query modeling in a data warehousing environment
Advanced familiarity with Excel (ex. you know how to combine tables that utilize .CSV files and Google Sheets, creating pivot tables and formulas)
Ability to synthesize complex data and information into key insights and to communicate these key insights via reporting, dashboards and other presentation formats as needed
Comfort and proficiency in working collaboratively with clinical experts (e.g. physicians, nurses, care coordinators) on data analyses and output to ensure high quality clinical output
Experience and demonstrated ability to communicate and present impactful to all levels of internal and external stakeholders
Ability to multitask, prioritize, adapt to change, work well under pressure in an entrepreneurial environment, meet deadlines, and manage a project from start to finish
You thrive in a diverse, cross-functional team, collaborating with people throughout the company
