You will solve problems and answer questions – using data – for other departments to help us reduce costs, reduce errors, and be a better organization for our 17 million members.

What You’ll Do

Every day, you will help solve business problems presented to us by stakeholders using data. You will get a scenario or problem, such as, “We need to reduce cycle times,” and then pull, analyze, and interpret data relevant to that scenario.

You will pull data from SQL databases. You will analyze and interpret data using Python, R, or other tools. You will determine patterns or trends and their statistical significance to the problem. To visualize the data, you will use Tableau.

Once you have done your analysis, paired with a data engineer, you will present your findings to the stakeholder and confirm, refute or simply acknowledge a hypothesis. Your work may be implemented or may develop into something else. This role is remote, but you must be able to report to the Costa Mesa. CA office for regular collaboration days.

What You’ll Need

To thrive in this role, you must have a solid foundation of statistics and data analysis. You must be able to describe a project where you pulled data, analyzed it, identified trends or patterns, determined significance, and delivered insights or recommendations to the business. What was your approach? What tools did you use and why? Did you get to the root cause of the issue? Did you confirm or refute a hypothesis? You must be able to speak to your involvement and decisions at each stage.

For pulling data, we use SQL so you must be proficient with this tool. To curate and analyze data, we use a variety of languages and programs: Python, R, and even Excel. You can choose whatever tool helps you best, but you must be proficient in either Python or R.

Excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility are a must. Very often, we get into the data and some aspect takes longer than we thought, or we have to pivot and change how we approach a problem. A dashboard works better than a model, perhaps. Then you have to explain to the stakeholder or the team why you made that change or why the deliverable is taking longer than expected. It’s all about being creative in your approach and communicating that frequently and clearly to people who may be less tech or data-savvy than you.

You have worked previously with an Agile team or understand these concepts. You expect to participate in daily standup meetings, you’ll complete your projects or stories during our bimonthly sprints, and you’re ready to meet frequent deployment deadlines.

We visit each community weekly to see patients and collaborate on patient health needs with staff. We also make it easier for patients to get care urgently with same- and/or next-day care, helping them avoid the ER and/or hospital where they're exposed to more health issues.
Our value-based offering has led to over 100 communities partnering with us in the last year and allowed us in achieving 10X patient growth. We're a fast-growing company that's backed by lead investors including First Round Capital, Google's AI fund, Canvas Ventures, Foundation Capital, Y Combinator, and Susa.

Partner with the management team and project leads (clinical and non-clinical) to design and create input metrics and output metrics that guide improvement and decisions
Support project teams with quantitative work to inform hypothesis selection and evaluation.
Partner with Operations in instrumenting workflows, tools, and systems to collect high-quality data at scale
Develop reporting/dashboards and work closely with internal clients to iterate on content and form as business needs change
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure upstream data quality, develop robust data pipelines, and create tooling for clients to self-serve via Looker
Partner with our Product, Clinical, and Operations teams to design data-driven care delivery workflows and ultimately dashboard prototypes that will consistently deliver remarkably personalized patient care. To this end, you will occasionally spend time inside Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) shadowing our Growth, Ops & Care Delivery teams to gather the context required to make excellent technical design decisions
What We're Looking For
Bachelor's degree in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Data Analysis, or equivalent
2-5 years experience as a data analyst
Ability to develop detailed data request specifications based on existing company data model for de-identified patient data pulls as inputs into analytics projects
Intermediate SQL experience with data and query modeling in a data warehousing environment
Advanced familiarity with Excel (ex. you know how to combine tables that utilize .CSV files and Google Sheets, creating pivot tables and formulas)
Ability to synthesize complex data and information into key insights and to communicate these key insights via reporting, dashboards and other presentation formats as needed
Comfort and proficiency in working collaboratively with clinical experts (e.g. physicians, nurses, care coordinators) on data analyses and output to ensure high quality clinical output

Ability to multitask, prioritize, adapt to change, work well under pressure in an entrepreneurial environment, meet deadlines, and manage a project from start to finish

Yes Hearing’s mission is to advance access to hearing aids for over 30 million Americans that currently suffer from hearing loss, yet do not own hearing aids. Hearing aids are proven to enhance the overall well-being of persons that wear the devices, yet the high costs associated with the purchase and the reluctance to actually visit a local audiologist mean millions of Americans do not get the care they need.

Data Scientist [NYC],"$135,305 /yr (est.)","Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?
We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.
Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.

You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.
Working at CarbonChain
To join CarbonChain, you'll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.
We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that's developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.
What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?
As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.
As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you'll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.
This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We're looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.
You can expect to have:
Ownership of your projects
Extensive client exposure
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value
Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.
Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.
Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.
Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.
Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.
GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.
Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.
Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.
You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.
What we require from applicants
Right to work in the US and willingness to come to the NYC office 2+ days a week
4+ years of relevant work experience
A passion for environmental issues
A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers
The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup
What we're offering
Healthcare
Competitive salary + generous equity package
Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing
$2,000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things
Tech equipment of your choice
Regular social activities
Generous amount of holidays, 26 days of annual leave
We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.
If you think your skills and experience match what we're looking for and you'd like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!

At Falling Colors, we don’t just build technology: we build impact. We take great pride in what we do for our communities with our products, and further seek to improve the world in everything we do. Our passion project is The White Building, a space rich with history. You can read more about this project at thewhitebuilding (dot) com on Instagram @thewhitebuilding. We use a portion of our profits to fund our Falling Colors Foundation, which paid out over $200,000 in small business grants to help our local businesses make it through uncertain times during the pandemic. We pay our employees to volunteer and do our best to protect them from burnout with a generous PTO policy, flex time, and paid holidays. We protect our employees’ futures by partnering with a B-certified financial group that manages our 401k accounts (and we contribute—not match—a percentage to those accounts). We understand the critical role we play as a business in the six determinants of social health, and we want to be the company that sets the bar and inspires others to be better.
We are in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with satellite offices across the United States. This is a hybrid position for a candidate residing in New Mexico or Colorado.

About You
We're looking for an individual who:

Working At SBS
What it's like working at our firm:
High flexibility. We believe in the ability of our team to determine the best way to complete their work. We measure outputs, not inputs. We don't have time sheets. We don't track hours. We don't pay attention to when and where our team works. Your schedule is yours to make.
High accountability. What we care about most is that we deliver on what we promise to our clients. In this respect, we measure and manage to our deliverable performance metrics and ensure each team member takes ownership over their accomplishment with a high level of quality that aligns with our core values
Great pay for great work. We pay based on the characteristics that matter: position (and its market value), level of mastery, and longevity with the firm. All of which aim to ensure each member of the team feels they are compensated well and can focus on great work.
Merit-based career progression. We have clearly established career tracks, performance benchmarks, and mastery levels set for all of our core positions. How quickly you progress is entirely under your control, with a quarterly review and bi-annual promotion consideration cycle in place to evaluate your progress.
Generous benefits. We offer a generous benefits package that includes medical, dental, and vision insurance enrollment; as well as an IRA match, tech stipend, 3 weeks of paid time off, and entry into our profit share bonus program after two years of service.

Data Scientist [NYC],"$135,305 /yr (est.)","Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?
We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.
Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.

You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.
Working at CarbonChain
To join CarbonChain, you'll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.
We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that's developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.
What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?
As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.
As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you'll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.
This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We're looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.
You can expect to have:
Ownership of your projects
Extensive client exposure
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value
Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.
Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.
Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.

COMPANY BACKGROUND*:

Canary Medical*
Canary Medical is a medical technology company focused on commercializing smart implants in the orthopedic, cardiovascular, and aesthetics markets. The company has established a considerable intellectual property portfolio surrounding its CHIRP (Canary Health Internal Reporting Processor) technology to facilitate development of active implanted devices capable of monitoring patient function utilizing MEMs sensor technology in concert with sophisticated power management algorithms and wireless data transmission.
The Canary ecosystem is comprised of an implantable smart device, a base station to transmit data from the device to a secure cloud structure, and a HIPAA-compliant cloud software system to store the information, convert the raw data to useful metrics, present said data on Patient and Clinician user interfaces, and mine data for clinical insights. The Summatix platform is adjunctive and seamlessly integrated with the Canary cloud enabling Clinicians to harness CMS RPM CPT codes in the delivery of patient care.
Canary both develops its own FDA approved products and partners with major and minor manufacturers to incorporate its smart CHIRP devices into their partner’s FDA approved devices, allowing transmission of information without clinical interpretation or medical intervention. This minimizes the regulatory burden on the medical device partner, as clinically interpreted data fall under the usual FDA regulatory pathways.
The company has a robust product pipeline in several therapeutic areas and is targeting a smart Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) implant as its first commercial US product within the next months, followed in quick succession by other total joint arthroplasty products (hip, shoulder) since approximately 90% of their core technology is shared across these areas. Canary’s cardiovascular efforts are targeting aneurysm, heart valves, and coronary stents monitoring. This aspect of the Canary product pipeline is earlier in development but is likewise expected to leverage core technologies from the orthopedic pipeline to reduce time to market, project costs, and regulatory risk.
